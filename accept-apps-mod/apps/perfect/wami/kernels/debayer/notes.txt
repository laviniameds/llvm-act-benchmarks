The error metric is clearly wrong.

Channels of rgb pixels supposedly have a max of 65535, but clearly this whole
range is not frequently generated. Thus, the error metric tends to report
a tiny fraction of the true error, and accept goes crazy perforating everything.

It's fully possible something else is wrong, as the error metric itself
is code I added to the driver.

While it is funny to see accept optimize everything, it's probably not that
useful. The right thing to do would be to look at some of the outputs and
figure out a reasonable error metric.
