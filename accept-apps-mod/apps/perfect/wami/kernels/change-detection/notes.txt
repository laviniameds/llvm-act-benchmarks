Ideally, the parameters passed to wami_gmm like foreground, mu, and sigma would
be approx, but attempting to make them so causes clang to abort during build.

There might be a better way to declare things that actually works; either
way accept should probably be fixed to just work.

In the meantime I have left the parameters precise, and added lots of
ENDORSE and ACCEPT_PERMIT to allow loop perforation to go ahead anyway.

There several loops with exits. I was unable to remove them by changing the
code (I did totally break the code though!) and ACCEPT_PERMIT doesn't work
for loop exits, so yeah, that doesn't work yet either.
